# GitHub Reviewer Extension

v.1.0

## Installation

1. Go to chrome://extensions and enable developer mode

2. Download this repo

3. On chrome://extensions, search for a button called **Load unpacked extension** or similar

4. Load the **src** folder. The extension will now work.

5. Go to [Create a personal **classic** token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with **read:user** prop.

6. Click on the extension and load the token

7. If you did everything ok, if you access an application, it would appear the *Github Contributions* section at the end. If that does not happen, neither the user has github, your token is wrong, you have the extension disabled (or js), or the username that the hacker entered does not exist on github.
